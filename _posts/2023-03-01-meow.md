First Blog Article, I will be completing all the FREE machines of the starting point of hackthebox.

This is the first starting point machine, I will explain the steps I followed to complete it and gain access to the machine.


## Task 1. What does the acronym VM stand for?

This refers to: 
```text
Virtual Machine
```
This is an environment that we use to virtualize some operating system.

## Task 2. What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell.


```text
Terminal
```
This is the console that allows us to "move", it is what is most used in this field, since from it, we will execute commands and perform attacks on our targets, among many things. 
and make attacks to our targets, among many things.


## Task 3. What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?


```text
openvpn
```
This is the service we use to access the hackthebox machines.

We can see what version of this service we have in our system, go to the terminal:
```bash
openvpn --version
```

In my case it returns this result: 
```bash
❯ openvpn --version
OpenVPN 2.5.7 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Jul  5 2022

```
## Task 4. What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the output of your VPN boot-up sequence output?


```text
tun
```
Basically the short way to refer to the interface.

## Task 5. What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?


```text
ping
```
Its main purpose is to manage the network connectivity status between a source and a device, with the help of an IP network.

We take advantage of this and confirm that we have connectivity with the htb machine and send it a packet to see if it sends it back to us:

```bash
ping -c 1 10.129.180.101
```
This is returned to us: 
```bash
❯ ping -c 1 10.129.180.101
PING 10.129.180.101 (10.129.180.101) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.129.180.101: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=56.1 ms

--- 10.129.180.101 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 56.106/56.106/56.106/0.000 ms
```
The machine returns the packet, this means that it is active and if we look at the ttl=63, so it indicates that we are in front of a linux machine. 

## Task 6. What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target?


The most common tool is:
```text
nmap
```
This allows us to find ports, whether they are open, filtered... 

We are going to use Nmap to look at open ports on the machine:

```bash
❯ nmap 10.129.180.101
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-20 14:49 AST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.180.101 (10.129.180.101)
Host is up (0.060s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open  telnet

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.06 seconds
```

As we can see, the machine has port 23 open and the telnet service is running on this port.
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open  telnet
```
## Task 7. What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?

```text
telnet
```
As we could see in the previous scan, port 23 is using the telnet service.

The publicly available Telnet service can leave its clients vulnerable to leaks of information such as usernames and passwords. Because Telnet is one of the first remote login protocols on the Internet, it does not provide built-in security measures and suffers from serious security problems.

We are going to connect to the machine through the telnet service, next to the machine's IP:
```bash
telnet 10.129.180.101 
```
When you enter the command, it returns a Login:
```bash
❯ telnet 10.129.180.101
Trying 10.129.180.101...
Connected to 10.129.180.101.
Escape character is '^]'.

Meow login:
```

## Task 8. What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?


The only user capable of doing this is:
```text
root
```
Since it has the highest privileges.

##  Submit root flag

We started in the Login with the user *root* and with this we would have access to the machine.

We locate the Flag:
```bash
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap
```
```bash
root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt 
b40abdfe23665f766f9c61ecba8****
```
