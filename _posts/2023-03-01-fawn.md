Second machine of the starting Point.


Step by step explanation, to gain access to the fawn machine of Very Easy difficulty.

On this machine we will be playing the FTP protocol (File Transfer Protocol). 

## Task 1. What does the 3-letter acronym FTP stand for?


```text
File Transfer Protocol
```
Is a protocol that allows files to be transferred directly from one device to another.

## Task 2. Which port does the FTP service listen on usually?


```text
21
```
FTP is an unusual service in that it uses two ports, a 'data' port and a 'command' port (also known as a control port). Traditionally, these are port 21 for the command port and port 20 for the data port.

## Task 3. What acronym is used for the secure version of FTP?

```text
SFTP
```

## Task 4. What is the command we can use to send an ICMP echo request to test our connection to the target?


In the previous article we talked about this tool:
```text
ping
```

Let's check if we have a connection to the victim machine:
```bash
ping -c 1 10.129.136.53
```

With this we indicate that we want to send a packet to that ip.
```bash
❯ ping -c 1 10.129.136.53
PING 10.129.136.53 (10.129.136.53) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.129.136.53: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=83.2 ms

--- 10.129.136.53 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 83.243/83.243/83.243/0.000 ms
```

It returns the packet, this means that our connection to the machine is active.

## Task 5. From your scans, what version is FTP running on the target?


We perform a scan with the Nmap tool to the victim ip:
```bash
❯ nmap -sV 10.129.136.53
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-21 12:32 AST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.136.53
Host is up (0.088s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
Service Info: OS: Unix

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.41 seconds                                                           
```
In this case, we want to see the version of FTP running on the victim machine, for this reason we use the -sV parameter and indicate that the response will tell us the version of the services found.

```text
vsftpd 3.0.3
```
## Task 6. From your scans, what OS type is running on the target?

In the scan performed above it tells us that the operating system is:
```text
Unix
```
## Task 7. What is the command we need to run in order to display the 'ftp' client help menu?


```bash 
ftp -h
```
With this command we display the help menu, using the -h (help) parameter.

## Task 8. What is username that is used over FTP when you want to log in without having an account?


```text
anonymous
```
Default FTP user.

We are going to use the ftp protocol to connect to the machine, with the default user: 
```bash
ftp 10.129.136.53
```
```bash
❯ ftp 10.129.136.53
Connected to 10.129.136.53.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.136.53:z3etxh): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> 
```

## Task 9. What is the response code we get for the FTP message 'Login successful'? 

In the previous question we saw that when connecting via ftp, the Login successful message, gives us as response code the number:

```text
230
```

## Task 10. There are a couple of commands we can use to list the files and directories available on the FTP server. One is dir. What is the other that is a common way to list files on a Linux system.


```text
ls
```

```bash
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||24177|)
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0              32 Jun 04  2021 flag.txt
226 Directory send OK.
```
As we can see, doing an ls shows us the flag.txt file.


## Task 11. What is the command used to download the file we found on the FTP server?


```text
get 
```

```bash
ftp> get flag.txt
local: flag.txt remote: flag.txt
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||52798|)
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for flag.txt (32 bytes).
100% |*******************************************************************************************************************************************|    32       10.66 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
226 Transfer complete.
32 bytes received in 00:00 (0.37 KiB/s)
```
To download files from an ftp service to our machine, we use get {filename}.

## Submit root flag

We locate the downloaded file on our machine.

```bash
❯ cat flag.txt
───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       │ File: flag.txt
